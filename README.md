# MyBaccaratApp
Android Baccarat Game
> This Android application is an Activity-based game that is in the initial stages of developement. Currently it features core mechanics and saves progress, but my vision for the game includes more of an immersive experience. 

# how to play 
> The goal of the game is 'bankrupt' the casino. The casino includes multiple tables with different Mininum and Maximum bets which ultimately lead to the final No-limit table. The game also has a 'casino loan' feature that will help the user to recover from a bad losing streak. However, all bets must be paid.

## afterword
> Currently i am a student at university and will likely not continue the project until i have completed my degree. For the purposes of my portfolio i've only included the raw source code for the core mechanics and the different Activities. Layout xml's, icons, and current (terrible) artwork are not included.
